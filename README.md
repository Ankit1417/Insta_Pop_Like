📸 Instagram Pop-like Animation
This project replicates the real-life "like" pop animation seen on Instagram, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When users double-tap or click, a smooth and visually appealing heart animation appears—just like the Instagram app experience.

Smooth CSS transitions and scaling effects

Lightweight and responsive design

Simple, clean code structure for easy customization

🚀 How It Works
Double-tap or click anywhere on the image to trigger the like animation.

A heart icon appears with a pop effect and fades away gracefully.
